## Evaluating the Cooperation Threshold

Allen et al. (2017) provide [MATLAB code](https://zenodo.org/record/276933#.Y9CG6MbMJhE) to calculate the cooperation threshold. We (L. Meng) have implemented their procedure in Python. The file `evaluate-threshold.py` calculates the cooperation threshold for each network in a given directory (in this case, downloaded from the [Animal Social Network Repository](https://github.com/bansallab/asnr)). In the `demo` directory, we provide the same code written as a Python function (`eval_threshold()`) and demonstration of that function's use (`evaluate-threshold-demo.py`) on an example network (`weighted_primate_matrix_5.graphml`). Note that the function can fail on large (stall) and/or disconnected (return NA) networks, but can accepted weighted or unweighted networks. The problem with large networks has to do with the complexity of the linear algebra solver, which is O(N^6). Our analysis did not include networks large enough to be problematic on a personal computer with 8 GB of RAM, but using our function with larger networks may require more computing resources. Directed networks are not covered by the Allen et al. (2017) theory, in part because of the possibility of sink nodes. 

## Dependencies

The file `analysis.R` depends on the [MuMIn](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MuMIn) package, available on CRAN. The file `evaluate-threshold.py` depends on [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/).
